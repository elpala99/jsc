\section{Untyped Lambda Calculus}
(Everything is extracted from \cite{kuyperset})
We suppose an infinite set of variables called $\mathcal{VAR}$. The, we define the terms of the lambda calculus the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\forall x \in \mathcal{VAR}$, $x$ is a term.
    \item If $M$ is a term and $x \in \mathcal{VAR}$, then $(\lambda x.M)$ is a term. (Abstraction)
    \item If $M$, $N$ are terms, then $(M \quad N)$ is a term. (Application)
\end{itemize}

A term like $\lambda x.M$ represents a function which has an input $x$ and returns an output $M$. Now, it is called a free variable of a lambda term $M$ if it is not ``cuantified'' by $\lambda$. It happens that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If a lambda-term contains no free variables it is called a \textbf{combinator}.
     \item If there are two lambda-terms and one can be renamed all the bound variables to obtain the other one, it is said that the two lambda-terms are equal.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
