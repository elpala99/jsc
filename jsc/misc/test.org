#+TITLE: Source Code Formatting

* SRC Block
When a =src= block is created inside a header it does not present any problem
with displaying an extra line.
#+begin_src
there is no extra line here
#+end_src

1. Adding a list adds an extra line because it adds an additional spaces when
   creating the =src= block.
   #+begin_src
there is whitespace here.
   #+end_src
2. Removing the spaces at the start of the block, end of the block or both
   removes this error:
#+begin_src
there is no whitespace here.
   #+end_src
The problem of using this method is that org mode breaks the list and does not
create more items using =C-RET=, as the indentation is broken.

* Other Header
For =:= it happens similarly.
: no extra line here here.

1. Creating a list and then adding =:=, it happens that:
   : whitespace here
2. Removing spaces before:
: whitespace not here.

This method also breaks the items list.
