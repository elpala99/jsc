#+TITLE: Test

Testing additional whitespace.

* Adding header for example
#+begin_src
there is not whitespace here
#+end_src

: no whitespace here.

1. Adding a list adds a whitespace because it adds an additional space when
   creating the =src= block.
   #+begin_src
there is whitespace here.
   #+end_src
   It can be caused by spaces at the end of the block.
#+begin_src
there is whitespace here.
   #+end_src
   Also by having spaces at the start of the block.
#+begin_src
there is whitespace here.
   #+end_src
   By erasing the additional spaces this problem does not occur.
#+begin_src
there is no whitespace here.
#+end_src

2. Lastly, using the =:= command it happens something similar.
   : there is whitespace here
   Now testing it removing the spaces:
: there is no whitespace here.
