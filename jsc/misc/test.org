#+TITLE: Test

Testing additional whitespace.

* Header
When a =src= block is created inside a header it does not present any problem.
#+begin_src
there is not whitespace here
#+end_src

Neither =:=.
: no whitespace here.

1. Adding a list adds a whitespace because it adds an additional space when
   creating the =src= block.
   #+begin_src
there is whitespace here.
   #+end_src
2. Removing the spaces at the start of the block, end of the block or both
   removes this error. This is seen in
#+begin_src
there is no whitespace here.
   #+end_src
The problem of using this method is that org mode breaks the list and does not
create more items using =C-RET=, as the indentation is broken.

* Other Header
1. This also applies for =:=
   : whitespace here
2. Removing spaces before:
: whitespace not here.

This method also breaks the items.
